This Quick Start sets up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture for SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition and deploys it into your AWS account.

SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition is highly-optimized, host-based replication software that extends Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). With WSFC cross-subnet failover and tunable heartbeat parameters, you can deploy geographically dispersed clusters. SIOS DataKeeper provides high availability and disaster recovery (DR) to your WSFC environment without the need for shared storage.

This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in a single AWS Region, across two Availability Zones. It also supports a data-replication node outside the cluster, with all nodes in the AWS Cloud.
