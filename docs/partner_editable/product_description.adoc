SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition is highly optimized, host-based replication software that extends Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). With WSFC cross-subnet failover and tunable heartbeat parameters, you can deploy geographically dispersed clusters. The addition of SIOS DataKeeper data replication helps you use WFSCâ€™s advanced features to support high availability and disaster recovery configurations without shared storage.

SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition provides replication in a virtual private cloud (VPC) within a single AWS Region across two Availability Zones. It also supports a data-replication node outside the cluster, with all nodes in the AWS Cloud.
