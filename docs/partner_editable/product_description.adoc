SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition is a highly optimized, host-based replication solution that integrates seamlessly with Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). WSFC
features, such as cross-subnet failover and tunable heartbeat parameters, make it possible for administrators to deploy geographically dispersed clusters. SIOS DataKeeper provides
the data replication mechanism that extends WSFC, and enables administrators to take advantage of these advanced features to support high availability and disaster recovery (DR)
configurations without the need for shared storage.

SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition provides replication in a virtual private cloud (VPC) within a single AWS Region across two Availability Zones. It also supports a data
replication node outside the cluster with all nodes in the AWS Cloud.
