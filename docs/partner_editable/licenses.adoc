This Quick Start uses Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from the http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace]. It
supports two licensing options:

* https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B072B62D1S[Pay as you go (PAYG)] — Use this consumption-based option to pay an hourly fee
determined by usage. Current prices are listed on the AWS Marketplace page and billed
to your AWS account. This option doesn’t require a license for SIOS DataKeeper.
* https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01MZFU2IE[Bring your own license (BYOL)] — Use this option if you have a current license for SIOS
DataKeeper Cluster Edition (which requires a run-time license for each server). You
can deploy the Quick Start without first signing up for a license, but you must have a
license to start and run SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition. You can contact SIOS to
request a http://us.sios.com/contact-us/[run-time license] or a http://us.sios.com/SAN-SANless-clusters/free-trial-evaluation-san-sanless-clusters[14-day, free, trial license].

Subscription instructions are provided in step 2 of the deployment instructions.
